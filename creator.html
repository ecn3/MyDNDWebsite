        <h2>Character Creater Overview</h2>
            <p>
            There is a lot of information that player needs to go over while creating a 
            character.  A player needs to select thier race, class, background, starting 
            equipment, starting stats, and starting skills.  In addition to that depending on the 
            race and class the player may need to choose starting spells, starting feature, 
            subrace, and subclass or variant.  With all of this information the Players Handbook 
            offers an easy to follow guide to character creation.  This goes as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your race/subrace</li>
            <li>Select your class/subclass</li>
            <li>Assign your stats</li>
            <li>Choose your skills</li>
            <li>Choose your equipment</li>
            <li>Choose spells if applicable</li>
            <li>Select your background</li>
            <li>Select your feature if applicable</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            While this seems logical there are problems with racial bonus not doing anything and 
            skill crossover.  For example the Dragonborn race has bonuses to Strength and 
            Charisma while the wizard class uses only Intelligence.  In Dungeons and Dragons 
            there is no additive effect for having the same skill twice, which means if the 
            background you selected comes with a skill that you already selected you lose out 
            on that skill.  Because of this the preferred method of creating a character is as 
            follows: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select your class</li>
            <li>Assign your stats</li>
            <li>Select a race/subrace that benefits your class</li>
            <li>Select a background</li>
            <li>Select your feature if applicable</li>
            <li>Sellect your skills</li>
            <li>Choose your equipment</li>
            <li>Select your spells if applicable</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Class Selection</h2>
        <p>
            There are 12 official classes and 2 playtest classes.  Playtest refers to almost 
            almost everything that can be found in the Unearthed Arcana section of the official
            D&D website.  Each of these classes play differently and they all have at least 2 
            subclass options that will be available by level 3.  The table below breaks down 
            the different classes.
